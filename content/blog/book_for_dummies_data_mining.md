## Introduction

    written for
      business users
      heard a little about dm


## ch01: Catching the Data-Mining Train

    Getting Real about DM
      Not your professor's statistics
      value of dm
        ex of information
          retailer loyalty program
            which customers are likely to spend 
              a lot
              a little
            based on information gathered from first visit
          manufacturer: accidental release of toxic materials
            prevent dangerous accidents
          insurance: 
            an office processes certain claim types more quickly
            right place for best practices
          advertising
            which ad works better?
              one that has female face, or male face
              many images vs. a few
              same copy but different layouts
    Doing what DM do
      focusing on business
      understanding their time
        most time: data preparation
      process
        crisp-dm
          business understanding
          data understanding
          data preparation
          modeling
          evaluation
          deployment
      making models
        report 
          can show
            sales down by region, channel
            declines are widespread?
          cannot
            why sales declined
            what actions to take
        model
          factors that impact sales
          actions that increase sales
      understanding mathematical models
      putting information into action
    Discovering Tools and Methods
      visual programming
      working quick
      testing


## ch02: A Day in Your Life As data Miner

    Starting your day off right
    Understanding your business
    understanding your data
      project
        predict land ownership
      explore data and document it
        ranges of variables
        missing values
        not all variables are documented
        ex
          variable name | type | missing | range/summary | min | max | median
          taxkey | integer | 30 | histogram |
        describe variable summaries
          ex
            variable | description
            bi_viol 
              description: unknown
              type: string
              range: x to xxx
              missing: 0
              assessment: not good for modeling. all cases have same value. reason unknown
              next: won't use in this project
            taxkey
              assessment: small number of cases missing. some have less than 10 digits. probably due to leading zeros
              next: clean this variable
            ca_class
              assess: good
    Deriving new variables
      flow
        read csv -> select atributes -> filter examples -> cut -> generate attributes -> select attributes -> sample -> write csv
      filtering out cases
        condition: no missing
      cutting variables down to five characters
        attribute filter type: subset
        attributes: ...
        first character: 1
        last character index: 5
      functions for generating new variables
        attribute name: ntlocal
        function expressions:
          if ( geo_zip_code == owner_zip, 0, 1 )
      discard variables no longer needed
      balancing the data
        sample size per class
          class |Â size
          yes | 4000
          no | 4000
    Modeling Your Data


## ch03 Teaming Up To Reach Your Goals

    Nothing could be finer than to be a data miner
      You can be a data miner
        ex: 2
          public safety: NY Fire Department
            identify factors that put buildings at risk for fire
            output: risk score for 300K buildings
            use: inspect building with risk
          retail
            amazon.com
            individualize product recommendations
            test functional and cosmetic aspects of website
          medical and survey research
            smoking
            identify messages that effectively discourage youth from smoking
      Using the knowledge you have
    Data Miners Play Nicely with Others
      Cooperation is a necessity
      Oh, the people you'll meet
    Working with Executives
      Greetings and elicitations
      Lining up your priorities
      Talking data mining with executives
          


## ch04 Learning the Laws of Data Mining

    1. law: business goals
      business objectives are the origin of every data mining solution
    2. law: business knowledge
      business knowledge is central to every step
    3. law: data preparation
      data preparation is more than half of every dm process
    4. law: right model
      right model for a given application can only be discovered by experiment
      NFL-DM: no free lunch for data miner	what is a model
        mathematical relation
          represents a pattern
            observed in data
      Tom Khabaza
    5. law: pattern
      there are always patterns
      successful exploration begins with a goal
        cook, peary -> north pole
    6. law: amplification
      dm amplifies perception
        enables you to understand your business better than without it
        like a magnifier or microscope
    7. law: prediction
      prediction increases information locally by generalization
      ex
        customer enters store
        how much will customer spend?
        you don't know him
          best estimate: average amount
        he heads for electronics
          estimate: higher
    8. law: value
      value of dm results is not determined by accuracy or stability of predictive models
      dm
        don't fuss over theory
        uses testing rather than statistical theory to justify
      stats
        fuss over theory
        accuracy and stability important
    9. law: change
      all patterns are subject to change


## ch05: Embracing the Data-Mining Process

    Whose standard is it, anyway?
      crisp-dm standard

              no independent power
            best opportunity: when property changes hands
              best time: before property is about to change ownership
