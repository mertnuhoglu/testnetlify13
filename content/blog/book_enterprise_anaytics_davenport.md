### 2. The Return on Investments in Analytics

    Traditional ROI Analysis
      roi = ( total value / benefits - total investment ) / total investment
      ex
        selecting high-potential customers for direct-mail campaign
          mine CRM data
          send mail to customers who meet a criteria
        building model
          investment cost: 50 K
        expected benefit: 75 K
        roi = ( 75 - 50 ) / 50 = 50%
      cash flow and roi
        assumption: costs and benefits occur at the same time
        rarely occurs
      credible roi
        based on credible business case
